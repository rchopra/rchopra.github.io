Use the guides as a reference and to help you study the major topics of the class. I've tried to condense everything you need to know into an easily digestible reference. As always, please look at the lecture materials for those topics for more detail.

### **General Study Tips**
- **Practice**: Write small programs to familiarize yourself with syntax and concepts.
- **Use Python Tutor**: [Visualize](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) how your code executes.
- **Experiment**: Modify example code and observe the effects.
