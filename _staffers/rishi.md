I am a Chicago-based software engineer at Google where I work on the Search team. Prior to Google, I received a BS in Mathematical & Computational Science at Stanford and an MS in Statistics from the University of Chicago. After graduating I worked as a data scientist and software engineer in professional sports with clubs in baseball (MLB, KBO) and soccer (Premier League). This semester I'm taking a sabbatical from my usual work to teach Computer Science here at Morgan State through the Google in Residence program. I feel very lucky to be here and am so excited for what we're going to learn in COSC 111!
