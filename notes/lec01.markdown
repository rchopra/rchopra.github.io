# What is Computer Science?

Computer science is theoretical and mathematical. Software engineering is the
practice of using that theory to solve real-world problems. It's about working
with other people and includes the "soft skills" required of any human endeavor
that's about working with other humans.

## Who is a computer scientist?

## Difference between Computer Science and Software Engineering

This is like the difference between theory and practice. Or more concretely, the
difference between being a physicist and a mechanic. To be a good mechanic, you
have a robust mental model about how the car works, but you also have to get
your hands dirty and solve real problems.


## Course Info and Logistics

We also discussed how the course is going to work, but all that and more is
covered in great details in the [syllabus](../syllabus/).
