## Course Info

Welcome to COSC 111! This is the first class in the computer science sequence.
As such, we'll be focusing on foundational knowledge as well as developing
skills that will help you succeed in future courses. This course doesn’t
require any prior programming knowledge.

### Why I'm here

This course is part of a program called Google In Residence (GIR) where I, a
software engineer at Google, take a semester out of my regular work to teach
here at Morgan. I can directly trace my current career to the opportunities I
had to explore computer science (CS) as a student. I strive to offer the same
opportunities to you so that you can determine if this is a field that you are
interested in pursuing. I find that hands-on experience is the most engaging
way to learn CS so we will spend quite a bit of time actively writing code.

### Course goals

### Learning outcomes

At the end of the course, the student should be able to:
* Identify the pillars of computational thinking (CT) approaches
* Develop a standard algorithm, and illustrate it in pseudocode and flowchart
  to solve any given problem
* Explain, differentiate and apply the concepts of semantics, syntax, and
  abstraction in programming
* Practice the programming constructs: sequence, selection, and iteration as
  part of programming assignments
* Identify and fix coding errors in a program
* Use built-in functions and import modules when a program requires
* Design and write their own functions and modules
* Apply basic data structures (list, tuple, and dictionary) to solve problems

### Technical details

This is a 4 credit course with no prerequisites. We will have both lectures and
homework/projects every week. You should expect to spend **several hours each
week** working on homework and projects outside of class.

### Course materials

For all labs, homeworks, and projects, we will be submitting code assignments
using [EdStem](http://edstem.org) (instructions in the first lab/homework that
uses it). We’ll also use [Slido](https://slido.com) for in-class interactions
and Q&A.

We’ll be using [Canvas](https://morganstate.instructure.com/) for grades and as
a hub for attached files, slides, video recordings, etc.

There’s no required textbook for this course, but if you’d like an additional
resource, there’s a free online textbook called [Foundations of Python
Programming](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/fopp/index.html)
that covers most of the material of this course.

## Course Policies

These are how I expect you to give yourself and your classmates a functional,
successful learning environment.

### Attendance

Each class will have a lot of interaction with me, with the TAs, with the other
students, and with the computer. In order to get the most out of it, you need
to be present for classes with a computer. If for any reason you cannot attend
class, please let me know as soon as possible. Absences will be handled on a
case by case basis; please note that attendance is part of your grade.

Everyone will check in each day on Slido. You can open this on your phone or on
your computer.

### Academic Honesty

Collaborating is a key part of computer science. No one person could write all
of the code that it takes to run most things that you use every day.
Recognizing who did the work is equally important. People have worked hard to
create this content and it is important to honor their time and effort by only
using the content with proper licensing or attribution. Additionally, I want to
make sure that you understand what's going on in the class.

For labs, you are encouraged to get help from me, the TAs, the Internet, or
other students, but you may not divide-and-conquer or copy code directly from
somewhere else. Each student must submit their labs independently and elaborate
on who they collaborated with and how.

For projects and homework assignments, you are encouraged to get help from me,
the TAs, or the Internet, but you may not copy any code directly from somewhere
else. You may get general help from other students, but you may not discuss
exact code or specific solutions.

Exams and quizzes must be done independently. Failure to follow this policy is
against the rules of the University and is subject to disciplinary actions, up
to and including a grade of “F” for the course and a letter of fact in the
student’s record.

### Technology

#### In Class

We will be holding class on campus in the classroom. Throughout the course, we
will often be writing code in class, so it is important that you have a
computer accessible during class.

Please do your best to refrain from using your computer or cell phone for
non-class-related purposes during class. The classes will be much more
enjoyable and productive for everyone involved if we are all fully engaged. We
have a lot of material to get through and only one semester to cover it all, so
let’s make the most of that precious time.

#### Out of Class

You will need access to a web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) -
preferably on a computer - and a high-speed internet connection.

Please check your @morgan.edu email and Canvas daily. I will share materials
and make course announcements through these methods. Assignments will be
assigned and submitted through edstem. We will set up an account with your
@morgan.edu email address in one of the first labs of the class that you will
use for the rest of the semester.

If you need any help with any of these out of class requirements, please ask!
We'll figure out a solution together.

### Accessibility and Inclusion

I believe that every one of you belongs in this class. I want to work with you
to help you succeed. If the format of the class is not working for you, please
reach out to me and we can find a way to make things work for you. If you need
specific accommodations, contact the Office of Student Disability Support
Services (SDSS) to register. See [morgan.edu/SDSS](https://morgan.edu/SDSS) for
more details.

I also want to hear from every one of you. I want you to ask questions when you
don't understand or tell me when you've got it already. If you ever feel like
you have a question that's "too silly/dumb to ask," it's not. There are other
students who probably are having the same problem.

Likewise, I expect all of you to allow your classmates' voices to be heard.
When somebody is speaking, the whole class should be hands-down paying
attention, whether it's asking a question or answering one.

#### Ways to get help
* Ask me in class
* Ask the TAs in class
* Come to office hours
* Ask your peers in class
* Send me an email: rishi.chopra@morgan.edu
* Search the Internet (NOT for the exact answer, just to get you unstuck)
* Come to office hours
* Look at past assignments
* Look at the course materials in Canvas
* Ask on edstem
* Tutoring
* Come to office hours
* Did I mention you should come to office hours?

If for whatever reason you still feel uncomfortable asking a question, I've set
up an anonymous [help form](https://forms.gle/6BkUQQczLJMSJ8rB7). I'll monitor
it throughout the semester and will cover the answers in class.

## Assignments and Grading

Assignment due dates will be visible in Canvas and EdStem, and typically will
be due at 11:59 p.m. ET on the day it’s due. For all assignments you must
follow the [Academic Honesty](#) policy above.

### Grading Scale

| Grade       | Score     |
|-------------|-----------|
| A           | 90 - 100% |
| B           | 80 - 89%  |
| C           | 70 - 79%  |
| D           | 60 - 69%  |
| F           | <59%      |
| n/a or None | 0         |

### Grading Breakdown

| Assignment  | Weight |
|-------------|-------:|
| Labs        |    10% |
| Quizzes     |    10% |
| Midterm     |    15% |
| HW/Projects |    40% |
| Final       |    15% |
| Attendance  |    10% |

### Late policy

A lot of the content we will cover builds upon previous content. As such, you
need to make sure you're keeping up with the course, including turning work in
on time. You have 5 late assignments that you can use throughout the semester
for a 15% penalty. I will keep track of these. No work will be accepted more
than 1 week late because I want to make sure that you understand the topics
we've covered before moving on.

**Note: This means that any homework/project assignment that is turned in late
will only be eligible for 85% credit.**

### Labs, Homeworks, and Projects

Labs are designed to help you explore a topic, so they will be graded for
completeness not correctness. I want you to feel comfortable making mistakes in
class.

Lab assignments will be started in class, and will be due 5 days later. For
example, if the lab is started in class on Friday, it will be due Tuesday at
11:59 p.m. ET.

Homeworks will focus more on practicing a specific skill or principle, and may
consist of several small questions/problems. Projects will consist of one
larger problem where you’ll need to apply many different concepts you’ve
learned in the class together for a complete solution. Homework and projects
will be graded on correctness to demonstrate that you can apply the skills
we've learned in class.

Homework and project assignments will be due at minimum 1 week after they are
assigned. Projects will typically be larger in scope and more difficult, and
accordingly you will have more time to complete these assignments.

### Quizzes

There will be a short quiz at the last hour of lecture each week. These quizzes
will cover what we talked about in class the week prior. They will be
administered through EdStem and will include multiple-choice, T/F, and short
answer questions (e.g. writing a block of code or predicting output).

Quizzes are graded for correctness and must be done independently. Weeks that
have exams will not have quizzes. Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped at the
end of the semester.

### Exams

There will be 2 exams in this class. The midterm exam will be during the week
of October 14 and cover everything that we've done through that point. The
final exam will cover everything after the midterm up until the end of the
course.

#### Test Corrections

Test corrections will be offered for the midterm. After receiving your graded
midterm, you may re-do the problems you got wrong for up to half the points you
missed. You’re encouraged to get help from me or the TAs while working on test
corrections, but you may not ask other students for help. The due date for test
corrections will be posted on Canvas.

## Disclaimer

This syllabus is subject to change as the semester goes on. We may find that
certain components aren't working for us, whether it's the speed of the course
schedule or the technology policy. In that case, I will make changes that will
be reflected here on the course website.
